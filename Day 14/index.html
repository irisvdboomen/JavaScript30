    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // when changing one, only this one will be updated
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); 
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // age2 won't change, since at the beginning let age2 = age, and here age was 100

    let name = 'Iris';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Iris Iris
    name = 'Saar';
    console.log(name, name2); // Saar Iris

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Iris';
    // console.log(players, team);
    // now both will be updated, since team is a reference to players. When you update an array, it will always reference back 

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // if you type team2, it will give you the players as above. when you type team2[3] = 'Iris', it will change the player on 4 to Iris. Now team2 has Iris, and players still has the old version

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // ES6 spread will take all the players out of the original array and place it into the new one
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Saar';
    console.log(team4); // players will still have the original players, team4 now has Saar instead of Poppy

    // or (prefer this one)
    // if you type team5[3] = '...' and then team5 aggain. it will update for team5. but if you type players, it will remain as the original
    const team5 = Array.from(players)


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // below won't make a copy, but a reference
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // now number has been added and age is changed
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100, 
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // in the console if you type JSON.stringify(wes) won't return as an object, but as a string.
    // but if you type JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)) it will return as an object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
